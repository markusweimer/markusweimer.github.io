title: "Home Assistant: Detect whether the TV is on based on power measure of a smart plug"

I plugged my TV into a smart plug which conveniently also measures power flow
through it. I wanted to use this to detect whether the TV was on.

**The bad way:** Initially, I fumbled my way with an `input_boolean` and two
automations: One triggered when more than 10W were flowing to set the
`input_boolean` to `true`. And another one to set it to `false` when power flow
was below 10W.

**The better way:** Turns out there is a much easier way to do this with the
[`template`][template] platform. Here is what I arrived at:

```yaml
template:
  - binary_sensor:
    - name: "TV is on"
      state: "{% raw %} {{states('sensor.tv_power_switch_smartenergy_metering')|float >10}} {% endraw %}"
      icon: mdi:television
```

This creates a new `binary_sensor` in the system with name `TV is on` and entity
ID `binary_sensor.tv_is_on` that tracks whether or not the power flow through
the sensor `sensor.tv_power_switch_smartenergy_metering` is greater than `10`.
The unit of measure for the smart plug I have is W.

Next up is to give the same treatment to the washing machine.
