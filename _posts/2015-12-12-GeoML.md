## Abstract

> In large organizations, data is “born” in data centers all around the world. Learning requires a global view of such data. This new class of geo-distributed machine learning (GDML) applications need to cope with: 1) scarce and expensive cross-data center bandwidth, and 2) growing privacy concerns that are pushing for stricter data sovereignty regulations.
>
> In this paper, we formalize this problem, show that the current state-of-the-art lacks proper support for GDML applications, and propose an initial system and algorithm that perform training in a geo-distributed fashion. Our empirical evaluation conﬁrms the general validity of our approach, but many research challenges remain open.
