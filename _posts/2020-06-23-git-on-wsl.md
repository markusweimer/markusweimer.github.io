title: "Git on the Windows Subsystem for Linux"
---

I do most of my dev work on WSL, with the help of some nice integrations with the Windows side of the machine. I run both VS Code and the Git credential manager on Windows, called from within Linux:

## Use Visual Studio Code for Windows
```
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

## Use the Windows credential manager

  1. Install [git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/).
  2. Add the following to your git config, e.g. via `git config --global -e`

```
[credential]
    helper = /mnt/c/Program\\ Files/Git/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-credential-manager.exe
```
