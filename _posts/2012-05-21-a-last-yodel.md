title: A last yodel
---

Friday was my last day at Yahoo!. It have been 3 amazing years, with lots of fun
(bringing spammers to tears), challenging problems (damn! spammers aren't
stupid!) and the occasional buh-buh (Really, I did not *mean* to kill that
several thousand node Hadoop cluster. Several times. On a weekend. Really.) Most
of all, it has been three years of learning, growing and being challenged in the
best of ways. For that, I'm thankful to the people that created the place and
those that shared the time with me. It was the best job I ever had.
