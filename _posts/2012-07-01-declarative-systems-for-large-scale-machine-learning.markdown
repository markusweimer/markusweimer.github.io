**Abstract**


<blockquote>In this article, we make the case for a declarative foundation for data-intensive machine learning systems. Instead of creating a new system for each speciﬁc ﬂavor of machine learning task, or hardcoding new optimizations, we argue for the use of recursive queries to program a variety of machine learning algorithms. By taking this approach, database query optimization techniques can be utilized to identify eﬀective execution plans, and the resulting runtime plans can be executed on a single uniﬁed data-parallel query processing engine.</blockquote>
