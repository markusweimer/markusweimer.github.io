title: How to make a C++ project compile in Visual Studio 2013 and 2015
---

Over in Apache [REEF], we [needed to make our solution compile in both Visual Studio 2013 and 2015][REEF-743]. The main impediment to that was the C++ code in the project, which needs to be compiled with the "right" compiler, depending on the version of Visual Studio used. Below, I describe how we created a project file that can be compiled uniformly across Visual Studio versions.

If we wanted to *only* support Visual Studio 2015, life would have been simple: Right click the offending project in Visual Studio 2015, and have it converted. However, this creates a project file that can't be compiled in Visual Studio 2013.  Instead, we changed the project file support both Visual Studio 2013 and 2015.

When opening `.vcxproj` file created with Visual Studio 2013, you typically find something like this inside:

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|x64'" Label="Configuration">
    <PlatformToolset>v120</PlatformToolset>
</PropertyGroup>
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|x64'" Label="Configuration">
    <PlatformToolset>v120</PlatformToolset>
</PropertyGroup>    
```

For Visual Studio 2015, you will find almost the same:

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|x64'" Label="Configuration">
    <PlatformToolset>v140</PlatformToolset>
</PropertyGroup>
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|x64'" Label="Configuration">
    <PlatformToolset>v140</PlatformToolset>
</PropertyGroup>    
```

The only difference is the `<PlatformToolset>`, which needs to be set to `v120` for Visual Studio 2013 and `v140` for Visual Studio 2015. Hence, we can set the `<PlatformToolset>` based on the version of Visual Studio used to execute this build. That version is found in `$(VisualStudioVersion)`. It is `12.0` for Visual Studio 2013 and `14.0` for Visual Studio 2015.

Putting it all together allowed us to follow a very [simple approach][PR]. We removed the `<PlatformToolset>` elements from these `<PropertyGroup>`s and instead added a new one, that sets it based on the version of Visual Studio used. 

```xml
<!--
    Switch the PlatformToolset based on the Visual Studio Version
-->
<PropertyGroup>
    <!-- Assume Visual Studio 2015 / 14.0 as the default -->
    <VisualStudioVersion Condition="'$(VisualStudioVersion)' == ''">14.0</VisualStudioVersion>
</PropertyGroup>
<!-- Visual Studio 2013 (12.0) -->
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(VisualStudioVersion)' == '12.0'">
    <PlatformToolset>v120</PlatformToolset>
</PropertyGroup>
<!-- Visual Studio 2015 (14.0) -->
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(VisualStudioVersion)' == '14.0'">
    <PlatformToolset>v140</PlatformToolset>
</PropertyGroup>
<!--
    End of: Switch the PlatformToolset based on the Visual Studio Version
-->
```

With this code in place, both Visual Studio 2013 and 2015 were able to compile the REEF code.
