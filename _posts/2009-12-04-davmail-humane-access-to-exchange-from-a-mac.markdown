[DavMail](http://davmail.sourceforge.net/) is an Open Source app that allows Mac users without the "dream team" Snow Leopard/Exchange 2007 at their disposal to access their Exchange Mail, Calender and Address Book through Apple Mail, iCal and Address Book.

Works like a charm for me, including the handling of invitations and other "advanced" Exchange features. Â If only I have known about it earlier...
