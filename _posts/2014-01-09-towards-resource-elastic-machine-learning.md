## Abstract

> In this article, we argue that resource elasticity is a key requirement for
distributed machine learning. Not only do computational resources disappear
without warning (e.g. due to machine failure), modern resource managers also
re-negotiate the available resources while a job is running: Additional machines
may have become available or already reserved ones have been re-assigned to
other jobs. We show how to formalize this problem and present an initial
approach for linear learners.
