## Abstract

> Machine learning (ML) techniques are enjoying rapidly increasing adoption.
> However, designing and implementing the systems that support ML models in
> real-world deployments remains a significant obstacle, in large part due to
> the radically different development and deployment profile of modern ML
> methods, and the range of practical concerns that come with broader adoption.
> We propose to foster a new systems machine learning research community at the
> intersection of the traditional systems and ML communities, focused on topics
> such as hardware systems for ML, software systems for ML, and ML optimized for
> metrics beyond predictive accuracy. To do this, we describe a new conference,
> MLSys, that explicitly targets research at the intersection of systems and
> machine learning with a program committee split evenly between experts in
> systems and ML, and an explicit focus on topics at the intersection of the
> two.
