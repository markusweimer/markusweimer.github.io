excerpt: A few people contacted me with the question how the NDCG optimization in
  our NIPS07 paper on collaborative ranking is done in detail. Unfortunately, we did
  not manage to squeeze these details into the paper itself. Luckily, there is the
  internet and I just uploaded my notes on this to the [CofiRank](http://cofirank.org/_media/ndcg.pdf?id=start&cache=cache)
  site. Please note that these notes are *not peer reviewed*. If you find a bug/typo/whatever
  in the derivations, I would be more than happy to hear from you!
