## Abstract

> Machine Learning (ML) adoption in the enterprise requires simpler and more
> efficient software infrastructureâ€”the bespoke solutions typical in large web
> companies are simply untenable. Model scoring, the process of obtaining
> predictions from a trained model over new data, is a primary contributor to
> infrastructure complexity and cost as models are trained once but used many
> times. In this paper we propose Hummingbird, a novel approach to model
> scoring, which compiles featurization operators and traditional ML models
> (e.g., decision trees) into a small set of tensor operations. This approach
> inherently reduces infrastructure complexity and directly leverages existing
> investments in Neural Network compilers and runtimes to generate efficient
> computations for both CPU and hardware accelerators. Our performance results
> are intriguing: despite replacing imperative computations (e.g., tree
> traversals) with tensor computation abstractions, Hummingbird is competitive
> and often outperforms hand-crafted kernels on micro-benchmarks on both CPU and
> GPU, while enabling seamless end-to-end acceleration of ML pipelines. We have
> released Hummingbird as open source.
