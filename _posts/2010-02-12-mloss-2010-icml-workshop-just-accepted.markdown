<blockquote>We are glad to announce that our [MLOSS 2010 workshop](http://mloss.org/workshop/icml10/) at this  years ICML conference has been accepted!

We are therefore happily accepting software submissions. The deadline  for the submissions is April 10th, 2010. If accepted, you can present  your software to the workshop audience, which is a great opportunity to  make your piece of software more known to the machine learning  community.

Like last time, we will use mloss.org for managing the submissions.  You basically just have to register your project with mloss.org and add  the tag `icml2010` to it. For more information, have a look  at the [workshop page](http://mloss.org/workshop/icml10/).</blockquote>
