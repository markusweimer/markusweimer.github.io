title: Optimization of the NDCG ranking score
---

A few people contacted me with the question how the NDCG optimization in our
NIPS07 paper on collaborative ranking is done in detail. Unfortunately, we did
not manage to squeeze these details into the paper itself. Luckily, there is the
internet and I just uploaded my notes on this to the
[CofiRank](http://cofirank.org/) site. Please note that these notes are *not
peer reviewed*. If you find a  bug/typo/whatever in the derivations, I would be
more than happy to hear from you!
