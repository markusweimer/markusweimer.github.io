title: Learning Systems 2015 CFP is up
---
The [call for papers](http://learningsys.org/) for the Learning Systems workshop
at NIPS 2015 has been posted:

> This workshop aims to bring together researchers from the machine learning and
systems communities. We invite high-quality extended abstracts of original
research addressing two major questions: (1) How should we design useful
abstractions and build scalable systems to support large-scale machine learning?
(2) How can we use machine learning in our systems to make them smarter and more
efficient?
