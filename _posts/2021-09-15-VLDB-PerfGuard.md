## Abstract

> Modern data processing systems require optimization at massive scale, and
> using machine learning to optimize these systems (ML-for-systems) has shown
> promising results. Unfortunately, ML-for-systems is subject to over
> generalizations that do not capture the large variety of workload patterns,
> and tend to augment the performance of certain subsets in the workload while
> regressing performance for others. In this paper, we introduce a performance
> safeguard system, called PerfGuard, that designs pre-production experiments
> for deploying ML-for-systems. Instead of searching the entire space of query
> plans (a well-known, intractable problem), we focus on query plan deltas (a
> significantly smaller space). PerfGuard formalizes these differences, and
> correlates plan deltas to important feedback signals, like execution cost. We
> describe the deep learning architecture and the end-to-end pipeline in
> PerfGuard that could be used with general relational databases. We show that
> this architecture improves on baseline models, and that our pipeline
> identifies key query plan components as major contributors to plan disparity.
> Offline experimentation shows PerfGuard as a promising approach, with many
> opportunities for future improvement.
