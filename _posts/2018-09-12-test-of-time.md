I am honored and humbled to receive the Test of Time Award together with Alex Smola and Alexandros Karatzoglou. It is given to our work on matrix factorization you can find [here][paper] on my website. [Here is the deck][slides] Alex used at ECML/PKDD 2018 today in his talk to commemorate the work, give it perspective with the field since and produce some ideas of where the field might go.
