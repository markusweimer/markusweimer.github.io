## Abstract

> There has recently been a lot of ongoing research in the areas of fairness,
> bias and explainability of machine learning (ML) models due to the
> self-evident or regulatory requirements of various ML applications. We make
> the following observation: All of these approaches require a robust
> understanding of the relationship between ML models and the data used to train
> them. In this work, we introduce the ML provenance tracking problem: the
> fundamental idea is to automatically track which columns in a dataset have
> been used to derive the features/labels of an ML model. We discuss the
> challenges in capturing such information in the context of Python, the most
> common language used by data scientists.
>
> We then present Vamsa, a modular system that extracts provenance from Python
> scripts without requiring any changes to the users' code. Using 26K real data
> science scripts, we verify the effectiveness of Vamsa in terms of coverage,
> and performance. We also evaluate Vamsa's accuracy on a smaller subset of
> manually labeled data. Our analysis shows that Vamsa's precision and recall
> range from 90.4% to 99.1% and its latency is in the order of milliseconds for
> average size scripts. Drawing from our experience in deploying ML models in
> production, we also present an example in which Vamsa helps automatically
> identify models that are affected by data corruption issues.
