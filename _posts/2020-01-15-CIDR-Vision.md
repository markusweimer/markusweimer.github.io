## Abstract

> Machine learning (ML) has proven itself in high-value web applications such as
> search ranking and is emerging as a powerful tool in a much broader range of
> enterprise scenarios including voice recognition and conversational
> understanding for customer support, autotuning for videoconferencing,
> intelligent feedback loops in large-scale sysops, manufacturing and autonomous
> vehicle management, complex financial predictions, just to name a few.
> Meanwhile, as the value of data is increasingly recognized and monetized,
> concerns about securing valuable data and risks to individual privacy have
> been growing. Consequently, rigorous data management has emerged as a key
> requirement in enterprise settings. How will these trends (ML growing
> popularity, and stricter data governance) intersect? What are the unmet
> requirements for applying ML in enterprise settings? What are the technical
> challenges for the DB community to solve? In this paper, we present our vision
> of how ML and database systems are likely to come together, and early steps we
> take towards making this vision a reality.
