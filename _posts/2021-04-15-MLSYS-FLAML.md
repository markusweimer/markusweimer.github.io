## Abstract

> We study the problem of using low computational cost to automate the choices
> of learners and hyperparameters for an ad-hoc training dataset and error
> metric, by conducting trials of different configurations on the given training
> data. We investigate the joint impact of multiple factors on both trial cost
> and model error, and propose several design guidelines. Following them, we
> build a fast and lightweight library FLAML which optimizes for low
> computational resource in finding accurate models. FLAML integrates several
> simple but effective search strategies into an adaptive system. It
> significantly outperforms top-ranked AutoML libraries on a large open source
> AutoML benchmark under equal, or sometimes orders of magnitude smaller budget
> constraints.
