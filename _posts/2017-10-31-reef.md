## Abstract

> Resource Managers like YARN and Mesos have emerged as a critical layer in the
> cloud computing system stack, but the developer abstractions for leasing
> cluster resources and instantiating application logic are very lowlevel. This
> flexibility comes at a high cost in terms of developer effort, as each
> application must repeatedly tackle the same challenges (e.g., fault tolerance,
> task scheduling and coordination) and reimplement common mechanisms (e.g.,
> caching, bulk-data transfers). This article presents REEF, a development
> framework that provides a control plane for scheduling and coordinating
> task-level (data-plane) work on cluster resources obtained from a Resource
> Manager. REEF provides mechanisms that facilitate resource reuse for data
> caching and state management abstractions that greatly ease the development of
> elastic data processing pipelines on cloud platforms that support a Resource
> Manager service. We illustrate the power of REEF by showing applications built
> atop: a distributed shell application, a machine-learning framework, a
> distributed in-memory caching system, and a port of the CORFU system. REEF is
> currently an Apache top-level project that has attracted contributors from
> several institutions and it is being used to develop several commercial
> offerings such as the Azure Stream Analytics service.
