title: Twitter's Heron, powered by Apache REEF
---

Today, Twitter [announced] the open sourcing of Heron, their successor to [Apache Storm][storm]. Heron's Apache Hadoop [YARN] port is built using [Apache REEF][REEF]. I'm excited and looking forward to the interesting edge cases they'll report over on the [dev list][dev] :-)
