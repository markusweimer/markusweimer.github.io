title: 'G''day mates: Australia April 2013'
---

I am travelling in Australia for a few days. I can be found in these locations:

  * I'm visiting the [Kinghorn Cancer center in Sydney](http://tkcc.org.au/) today, April 4th to learn more about the Big Data challenges faced in cancer research. Who knows, maybe we can help.
  * I'm visiting [NICTA](http://www.nicta.com.au/) in Sydney on April 5th where I will give a talk on some recent work on systems for machine learning on Big Data.
  * From April 8th an 12th, I can be found in Brisbane, attending and presenting at[ ICDE 2013](http://www.icde2013.org/):
    * I'm co-presenting the tutorial on Machine Learning on Big Data. Slides will be posted here soon (after the the tutorial, let's be realistic...)
    * I'm a panelist at the [Data Management in the Cloud](http://db.uwaterloo.ca/dmc2013) workshop. Which means that I get to argue in public.

Drop me an email if our locations intersect these two weeks and want to meet.
