## Abstract

> Machine Learning models are often composed of pipelines of transformations.
> While this design allows to efﬁciently execute single model components at
> trainingtime, prediction serving has different requirements such as low
> latency, high throughput and graceful performance degradation under heavy
> load. Current prediction serving systems consider models as black boxes,
> whereby prediction-time-speciﬁc optimizations are ignored in favor of ease of
> deployment. In this paper, we present PRETZEL, a prediction serving system
> introducing a novel white box architecture enabling both end-to-end and
> multi-model optimizations. Using production-like model pipelines, our
> experiments show that PRETZEL is able to introduce performance improvements
> over different dimensions; compared to state-of-the-art approaches PRETZEL is
> on average able to reduce 99th percentile latency by 5.5×while reducing memory
> footprint by 25×, and increasing throughput by 4.7×.
