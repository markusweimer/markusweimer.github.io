## Abstract

> As Machine Learning (ML) is becoming ubiquitously used within
> applications,developers need effective solutions to build and deploy their ML
> models across a large set of scenarios, from IoT devices to the cloud.
> Unfortunately,the current state of the art in model serving suggests to
> deliver predictions by running models in containers. While this solution eases
> the operationalization of models, we observed that it is not flexible enough
> to address the variety of ML scenarios encountered in large companies such as
> Microsoft. In this paper, we will overview ML.NET â€” a recently open sourced ML
> pipeline framework - and describe how ML models written in ML.NET can be
> seamlessly integrated into applications. Finally, we will discuss how model
> serving can be cast to a database problem,and provide insights on our recent
> experience in building a database optimizer for ML.NET pipelines.
