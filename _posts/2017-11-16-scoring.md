## Abstract

> Machine Learning models are often composed of sequences of transformations.
While this design makes it easy to decompose and efÔ¨Åciently execute single
model components at training time, predictions require low latency and
high-performance predictability whereby end-to-end and multi-model runtime
optimizations are eeded to meet such goals. This paper sheds some light on the
problem by introducing a new system design for high-performance prediction
serving. We report some preliminary results showing how our system design is
able to improve performance over several dimensions with respect to current
state-of-the-art approaches.
