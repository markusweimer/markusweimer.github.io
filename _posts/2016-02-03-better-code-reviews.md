title: Better code reviews for Apache REEF
---

Using GitHub and Apache's JIRA for code and issue management can be a bit of a pain. I started a Firefox extension that helps a bit with is. For now, it only adds the JIRA link to the [Pull Requests overview page][PR]. More to come in the future. [Download Version 0.0.1][Download], [Source].
