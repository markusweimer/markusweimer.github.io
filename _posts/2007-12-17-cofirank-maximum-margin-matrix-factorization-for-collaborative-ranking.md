## Abstract

> In this paper, we consider collaborative filtering as a ranking problem. We
present a method which uses Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization and optimizes
ranking instead of rating. We employ structured output prediction to optimize
directly for ranking scores. Experimental results show that our method gives
very good ranking scores and scales well on collaborative filtering tasks.
