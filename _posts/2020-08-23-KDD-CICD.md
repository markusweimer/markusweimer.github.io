## Abstract

> Continuous integration (CI) has been a de facto standard for building
> industrial-strength software. Yet, there is little attention towards applying
> CI to the development of machine learning (ML) applications until the very
> recent effort on the theoretical side. In this paper, we take a step forward
> to bring the theory into practice. We develop the first CI system for ML, to
> the best of our knowledge, that integrates seamlessly with existing ML
> development tools. We present its design and implementation details.
