I'm a Principal Scientist with the Cloud Information Services Laboratory (CISL) at [Microsoft], a member of the [Apache Software Foundation][ASF] and the current PMC chair (VP) of [Apache REEF][REEF].  My work focuses on large scale machine learning techniques, systems therefore and applications thereof. Recently, I have been heavily involved in systems building for these applications, both Apache [REEF] and internal ones.


## Software contributions

  * Apache [REEF]: A standard library for writing high performance applications on Big Data clusters.
  * [ScalOps] A domain specific language for distributed, larger scale data analytics and machine learning.
  * DIOS: A large scale machine learning library used at Yahoo!
  * [CofiRank](http://www.cofirank.org): A collaborative filtering algorithm that supports predicting the ranking of items as opposed to mere rating.
  * [BMRM](http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~chteo/BMRM.html): Open source, modular and scalable convex solver for many machine learning problems cast in the form of regularized risk minimization problem.
  * Elefant: A machine learning toolbox. My contributions include a bridge that renders [UIMA] annotators into feature extraction tools for machine learning. This code is Open Source under the Mozilla Public License.
  * [DkPro](http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/software/repository): A set of [UIMA] annotators developed by TU Darmstadt.

## Awards

  * Doctorate _summa cum laude_ in Computer Science from [TU Darmstadt](http://www.tu-darmstadt.de), 2009
  * Best Machine Learning Paper at [ECML-PKDD 2008](http://www.ecmlpkdd2008.org/)
  * Scholarship award at the [Machine Learning Summer School 2006](http://canberra06.mlss.cc/)
  * Diploma (masters' equivalent) _summa cum laude_ in Computer Science and Business Administration from [TU Darmstadt](http://www.tu-darmstadt.de), 2005
